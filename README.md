# RBSH - ReBorn SHell
This is an attempt at making a complete shell for Linux that is fast, tiny in size, and powerful

And by tiny, I mean as of [this commit](https://github.com/DeBeast591/RebornShell/commit/87af93d6e0babaaaa33d17176003de0676defea2), it's **179** lines SLOC! (Excluding the Example/ folder and the README)

# Installing
Installing is probably one of the most simple things!

Here's a one-liner to do it all for you:

```SH
git clone https://github.com/DeBeast591/RebornShell && mv RebornShell ~/.config/
```

Wherever your shell is defined, and replace it with:
```SH
python3 /home/<Your Username>/.config/RebornShell/rbsh.py
```

And that's it!

If it fails, make an issue on the issue tracker so you can get help or it can be fixed.
